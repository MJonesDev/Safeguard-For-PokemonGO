Safeguard is a Barebones Android app using a background service,
which will give notifications and dialogs every 15 minutes to keep people
safe and aware of their surroundings while playing Pokemon GO. 
This project is unfinished due to school, other projects, and because
Niantic themselves have put in many warnings in Ingress and Pokemon GO, 
making this app, in my opinion, almost useless. But the code is still here
for people to use if they wish.
